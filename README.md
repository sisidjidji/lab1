- ## Growth mindset :
a growth mindset for me is working harder on our selfs than we normaly do , push our selfs over the limits and never give up specialy when it gets hard and difficult or  when we are exausted from trying . my main keys to keep me in a growth mindset is:
1. never give up.
2. been optimistic and see the best side of everything.
3. tell my self everytime,  if someone can so i can too .
